# Icons

This folder houses the JSON files of my Font Awesome Pro for Iconify.

If you want to get these files yourself, then consult the Iconify docs found [here](https://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/bundles/)

then place all 6 icon set bundles in this folder with the names (and prefixes):

- `fat.json`: Font Awesome Thin
- `fas.json`: Font Awesome Solid
- `far.json`: Font Awesome Regular
- `fal.json`: Font Awesome Light
- `fab.json`: Font Awesome Brands
- `fad.json`: Font Awesome Duotone

As long as you get these files in this folder, you will be able to load these Icons.

I can't have these files in this repo since they're licensed, but if you'd like to purchase them yourself, you can do that on [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/docs/web/setup/quick-start)
